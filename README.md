# Data used for fitting MoSu-CHARMM force field

This depository contains all crystal structure files (CIF) of several optimized
adsorption configurations used to calculate fitting and validation datasets of
energy which were empplyed to fit and validate the MoSu-CHARMM. All adsortion
energies in these two data sets can be found in the spread sheet (excel file).

Because the level of theory was meteculously benchmarked against
experimental data, the adsorption energy datasets are very accurate and are the
best adsorption energies of several orgarnic compounds on the MoS<sub>2</sub>
surface. The optmized geometrical structures and corresponding energies here can
be used for further purposes such as machine learning and method development.

this set of data.
