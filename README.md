MoS2-FF-paper This depository contains all crystal structure files (CIF) of
several adsorption configurations used to obtain fitting and validation
datasets. All adsortion energies in these two data sets can be found in the
spread sheet (excel file).

The adsorption energy datasets are very accurate and are the best of adsorption
energies of several orgarnic compounds on the MoS2 surface, becasue the
calculation level of theory was meteculously benchmarked against experimental
data. The adsorption energy data here can be used for further purposes such as
machine learning and method development.
